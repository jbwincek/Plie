Notes on method 1:
    * recognizer.recognize_wit is the one to use for wit.ai
    * The callback gets called with a speech_recognition recognizer instance, and an AudioData
    instance.
        * They seem to be passed as positional arguments, and therefore a universal event handler
        would need to accept arbitrary positional arguments, and sort out the arguments by
        isinstance()-ing things. that would work though.
